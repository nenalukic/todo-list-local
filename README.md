# Simple ToDo List application with Node.js

A very basic ToDo application that lets you add new items to the list and delete items from the list. 

The application does not have any back end and is not storing changes.

## Usage

While in application directory, to run the applicatin open a terminal and type:
```
nodemon
```
Then open a browser and type:
```
localhost:3000
```
Then play by adding items to the list or deleting them.
